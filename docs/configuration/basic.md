## [main]

In this section, we can configure the basics of sushi. This includes what language your library was written in, your library path etc.

Starting with: `lang`, you need to specify in what language your library was written. Warning: if your language is, for example, C++, you should not set it to `.cpp` but to `.hpp`

Next, we have `lib_path`. This is the path for your library.

Lastly, there is `safe_mode`. Its recommended to keep this on, because when it is turned off, Sushi won't show which scripts it will run (if, for example, extending someones config)
