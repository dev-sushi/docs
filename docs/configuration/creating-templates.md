One way to help lingfo is to create templates. Templates are text files that are used to get rid of most configuration.

## What to know

Templates arent premade configurations. If you are looking to create an entire configuration, see: [configuration/premade-configurations](premade-configurations). You can only create them in official lingfo repository as a pull request.

## Creating

!!! note

    Before continuing, you will need to know basics of git, and have [this repository](https://github.com/lingfo/language-templates) cloned.

To create a language template, create a new folder in your branch and name it as your language file extension. So, for example: `C++` -> `cpp` or `rust` -> `rs`.

Inside that folder, create 3 files:

- if-statement.txt
- import-syntax.txt
- temp-file.txt

Here, we recommend to follow guide [about how to create configuration for lingfo](../basic). Files are named like keys in the configurations are.
After that you can create a pull request, and wait until its approved!
