Premade configurations are a great way to help lingfo and its community. If you are interested in creating one, follow these steps:

## Creating

First, create a new **GitHub** repository. Lingfo for now only supports premade configurations to be hosted on GitHub. Inside there, just add your configuration file from lingfo, push it and you are done.
Premade configurations are just lingfo configurations downloaded from network. However, in future (when plugin support will roll out) you will be able to extend these configurations with custom python script, to enhance the user experience (of e.g customizing the configuration).
